			<p>The PS5 port has been highlighted as one of the biggest issues with the next generation Sony console. A reoccuring issue with the current generation, gamers like myself were shocked when the problem carried over to their "best release yet, that is the biggest and best console avaliable." It's safe to say a lot of gamers aren't feeling that hype when it can't even connect to the TV. Shipping covered. Mail in your PS5 and pay the fee and we will have it back to you in 5-10 business days.</p>
